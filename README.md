   ## Installation 
   Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the express-handlebars (Links to an external site.) package to use Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 (Links to an external site.) and Sequelize (Links to an external site.) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

   ## Usage
   You’ll also need the dotenv package (Links to an external site.) to use environment variables, the bcrypt package (Links to an external site.) to hash passwords, and the express-session (Links to an external site.) and connect-session-sequelize (Links to an external site.) packages to add authentication.
